# Stroke Prediction Website

This is a web application built using Streamlit for predicting the risk of stroke based on patient data. The machine learning model used for prediction has been trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, glucose level, BMI, and other risk factors.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Access the web application through the provided URL.

## Input Data
The web application requires the following input data for predicting stroke risk:
- Age (in years)
- Gender (Male/Female/Other)
- Hypertension (Yes/No)
- Heart Disease (Yes/No)
- Ever Married (Yes/No)
- Work Type (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/Children/Never_worked)
- Residence Type (Urban/Rural)
- Average Glucose Level (in mg/dL)
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Smoking Status (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown)

## Output
The output of the prediction will indicate whether the individual is at risk of stroke or not.
